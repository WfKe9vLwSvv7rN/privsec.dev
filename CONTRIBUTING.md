# Contributing to PrivSec.dev

Thank you for your interest in contributing! In addition to standard GitHub etiquette, please follow these specific guidelines for contributing to PrivSec.dev.

<br>

## Security Vulnerabilities

Please follow the published [Security Policy](https://github.com/PrivSec-dev/privsec.dev/security/policy).

## Post Contribution Guidelines

_This section ("Post Contribution Guidelines") serves in part as a human&#8209;readable summary of (but not a substitute for) the [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement), with supplementary information documenting the current and intended procedures for contribution management. This section is not a license agreement and has no legal value. You should carefully review the terms and conditions of the actual Contributor License Agreement before agreeing to its terms and submitting a contribution._

<br>

**All posts submitted to PrivSec.dev are made available under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).** However, contributors retain copyright ownership and are free to do as they please with their own work, including posting to other websites and distribution under any license of their choosing. _If requested by the post author, PrivSec.dev will happily provide a [canonical link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element) within reason (usually pointing to the same post on the author's personal website). PrivSec.dev will not advertise alternative licenses for posts._

**PrivSec.dev places heavy emphasis on the autonomy of original post authors.** Whenever possible, original post authors will be invited to review issues and pull requests seeking to update their work. However, the PrivSec.dev team reserves the right to both implement and reject changes at their sole discretion, including but not limited to cases of trivial fixes (e.g.&nbsp;typographical error correction), unsatisfactory change quality, removal of old/outdated information, and an unresponsive or unreachable original post author.

The PrivSec.dev team will, if deemed justified for any reason on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case basis, archive posts and recreate them as derivative works not attributed to the original post author. Noteworthy contributors, especially who have previously contributed to the exact post in question, may be invited to assume authorship of the fork. If no authorship agreement can be amicably reached, the PrivSec.dev team shall retain editorial control of the post in question (though noteworthy contributors shall be invited to review change proposals).

Any request which requires rewriting Git history will almost certainly be rejected. Rewriting history is an extremely disruptive, tedious, and sometimes error&#8209;prone process which shall only be invoked in extenuating circumstances. Forks and local checkouts will retain the old commit log anyway, so history rewriting is ineffective for any sort of data erasure. Please assume all contributions are logged forever (by _someone_ even if not the PrivSec.dev team) and review your submissions carefully.

<br>

### Corrections and Changes to Existing Posts

Issues and pull requests are both acceptable.

Pull requests are preferable for minor changes like correcting typographical errors or rewording to improve clarity.

For more substantial changes, please open an issue to discuss your proposal before doing significant work on it. We would hate for you to spend significant time creating a pull request only for it to be rejected or need major changes.

_Note that we will likely defer you upstream for content originally/primarily published elsewhere. You are encouraged to proactively reach out to the upstream and open an issue here for tracking._

<br>

### New Post Submissions and Requests

Please informally present your request/proposal with the maintainers in a discussion (preferred) or in the PrivSec.dev [Matrix](https://joinmatrix.org) room, `#privsec:arcticfoxes.net`. Research is expected to be well&#8209;sourced with citations provided wherever applicable. If you are submitting content already written, feel free to directly open a pull request or draft pull request.

<br>

## Website Configuration Issues and Enhancements

Please open an issue and provide as much detail as possible (screenshot, how to reproduce, browser and version, etc.). If the solution is exceedingly trivial, you may open a pull request directly, but we strongly encourage opening an issue first as some apparent issues may be deliberate.

## Contributor License Agreement

_To clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, all contributors must indicate agreement with the following license terms. This Agreement is for Your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of the PrivSec.dev Organization and the recipients and users of its Work. It does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose._

For the purposes of this definition, "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the PrivSec.dev Organization or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic message boards and mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the PrivSec.dev Organization for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution".

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross&#8209;claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution or the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then all patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or for the Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section&nbsp;7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third&#8209;party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS&nbsp;IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON&#8209;INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to the PrivSec.dev Organization separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Sourced from a third&#8209;party: \[named&nbsp;here\]".

8. You agree to notify the PrivSec.dev Organization of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
